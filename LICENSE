 0. Arthur Perrin wrote this code. As long as you retain this
    notice, you can do DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO with this
    code. But in counterparty: if we meet someday, and you
    think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.
 1. Arthur Perrin is not responsible in case of data loss,
    malfunction, system crash or anything else.
    If you use it, you are responsible of what happens.
 2. You're not allowed to bitch about the Work. Not ever.
    Don't whine about how bad the design is or how the ergonomy
    sucks. If you don't like it, change it or stop using it.
 3. IPEV's VSC are allowed to use the software provided as long
    as they promise to show it to their successors.
 4. This software was half developed on working time at IPEV,
    EOST and ISTerre, and another half on personal time.
    Thus the ownership of this masterpiece is unclear and cannot
    be attributed only to IPEV.
